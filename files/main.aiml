                 Software engineers develop programs and operating systems for computers.
                They work with system programmers, analysts, and other engineers to
                design systems, project capabilities, and determine performance interfaces.
                Depending on the type of company they work for, software engineers will create 
                original code for software and applications. They also build reusable code for future use.

                Computer engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems. Computer 
                engineering is distinct from computer science because it focuses on hardware and 
                computer design.By creating and improving devices and programs, these technology 
                professionals help keep the world working safer, smarter, and faster.

                Network administrators design, manage, and maintain technological networks. 
                They work within organizations and government agencies to oversee local area networks, 
                wide area networks, network segments, and other data communication systems as needed.
                Network administrators provide support and oversight alike, working closely with colleagues 
                to explain how to use data storage and communication networks and ensure efficiency. 
                Often part of a larger, computer-related operational staff, network administrators may 
                supervise computer support and computer systems specialists.

                Full-stack developers are unique from other computer science professionals because of their broad, 
                versatile skill sets.Instead of specializing in back-end (server side) or front-end (client side) 
                development, these developers work on the entire "stack" of applications and websites. They can 
                often create an entire web application and are responsible for the entire software lifecycle. 
                Typical responsibilities include writing code, testing code, and analyzing user needs. Full-stack 
                developers often work remotely as freelancers, interacting with other developers and UX/UI designers.

                You are best-suited for a career as a Systems Analyst.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Computer systems analysts, or system architects, work with companies, institutions, 
                and independent clients. They survey and diagnose database program issues, resolve 
                user issues, and advise management about systems innovations to improve productivity. 
                Whether formally associated with corporations or acting as freelance consultants, 
                systems analysts work with program users and platforms to gauge issues. This role 
                requires communication and interpersonal skills, plus an understanding of standard 
                and new technologies.

                <br></br><br></br>
                Software engineers develop programs and operating systems for computers.
                They work with system programmers, analysts, and other engineers to
                design systems, project capabilities, and determine performance interfaces.
                Depending on the type of company they work for, software engineers will create 
                original code for software and applications. They also build reusable code for future use.

                You are best-suited for a career as a Video Game Designer.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Video game designers create the defining features of video games, including 
                characters, objectives, obstacles, levels and settings, and narratives. 
                Video game design is a cross-disciplinary field that incorporates computer science 
                and computer programming, graphic design, user experience, and creative writing. 
                Video game designers create new video games and improve existing ones. 
                They interact with many other professionals and teams, including technical and creative personnel.

                You are best-suited for a career as a Web Developer.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Web development includes building technical front-end and/or back-end code that informs site 
                functionality. Web developers may work exclusively on front-end code, back-end code, or both, 
                and many modern jobs also require overlap in web design. These professionals may work independently 
                on a freelance basis or with marketing or IT departments.

                You are best-suited for a career as a Full-Stack Developer.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Full-stack developers are unique from other computer science professionals because of their broad, 
                versatile skill sets.Instead of specializing in back-end (server side) or front-end (client side) 
                development, these developers work on the entire "stack" of applications and websites. They can 
                often create an entire web application and are responsible for the entire software lifecycle. 
                Typical responsibilities include writing code, testing code, and analyzing user needs. Full-stack 
                developers often work remotely as freelancers, interacting with other developers and UX/UI designers.

                Computer engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems. Computer 
                engineering is distinct from computer science because it focuses on hardware and 
                computer design.By creating and improving devices and programs, these technology 
                professionals help keep the world working safer, smarter, and faster.

                You are best-suited for a career as a Network Administrator.
                <br></br><br></br>
                Network administrators design, manage, and maintain technological networks. 
                They work within organizations and government agencies to oversee local area networks, 
                wide area networks, network segments, and other data communication systems as needed.
                Network administrators provide support and oversight alike, working closely with colleagues 
                to explain how to use data storage and communication networks and ensure efficiency. 
                Often part of a larger, computer-related operational staff, network administrators may 
                supervise computer support and computer systems specialists.
